				<p>
					In the CaSM Lab, we are interested in how people <b>work together</b> and learn from each other. We’re especially interested in understanding and designing <b>social media tools</b> to facilitate collaborations both at work and at play. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Our current research projects span a number of areas including <b>language</b> and social media, <b>public officials</b> and social media, social <b>network</b> analysis, and joining virtual <b>organizations</b>.

								The purpose of this research project is to better understand how social media are changing the relationships between celebrities and fans and between fans and the media they consume. We gather data for this research project through informal, semi-structured interviews. We also record interviews conducted face-to-face or over the phone and have a third party transcription service (e.g., Call Graph) transcribe the recordings. We are trying to figure out fans' motivations for using social media, and how they hope to gain from using social media.

								Public officials are adopting social media at increasing rates, and this project aims to understand the impact of that adoption. Using data from Twitter, primarily, we explore how officials, both elected and appointed, frame issues such as climate change. We also study how social media use impacts communication with constituents and civic engagement. See the CaSM Lab <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/CaSMLab/lists">Twitter lists page</a> to see some of the officials we’re currently studying.

								The information we see online, especially in user-generated content communities, is necessarily biased. Our goal in this project is to understand how the presentation is biased, how the design of communities creates bias in information presentation, and how to make users aware of the biases at work. We don’t argue that all bias is bad, just that it should be clear to users how the information they’re viewing may be biased. In some cases, the bias is dangerous. For instance, in mixed-gender online communities, males typically enjoy more power and prestige than females. In this project, we analyze user contributions to review sites such as the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) and WebMD in order to understand the relationships between language use, gender, and the perceived value of users’ contributions. Collaborative filtering systems often rely on user feedback about utility to determine which content to suggest and make readily available. Because users rarely adjust the filters’ defaults or dig very deeply into contributed content, it’s important that we understand how users judge the value of others’ contributions and how contributors understand and act upon community feedback so that we may ensure diversity in both content and participation in online communities.

								Social networks and social network analysis (SNA) are hot topics in research and public life. Our goal for projects in this area is to develop tools and methods that help make social network analysis accessible for non-experts so that we may leverage SNA to help society. For instance, we’re using IMDB data to explore ways for making social network data more easily translatable and to demonstrate user-friendly ways of conducting SNA. Dr. Hemphill’s affiliation with the <a href="http://www.smrfoundation.org/">Social Media Research Foundation</a> is integral to this project.
